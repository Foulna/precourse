### Teaching Assistant Payment Instructions

You might be wondering…==How do I get paid?==

Neuromatch has multiple ways to pay our TAs and other independent contractors. The most common way uses an accounting and electronic payment service for our independent contractors who are paid directly by Neuromatch. Some of our TAs are also paid by third party sponsors (you would know this ahead of time). Below we outline the steps for how you will get paid under each of these scenarios.

If you need Neuromatch’s address for anything, please use:
9450 SW Gemini Dr
PMB 70309
Beaverton, Oregon 97008-7105 US

## Paid directly by Neuromatch (almost everybody)
After the end of the course for which you are a TA, you will be paid in one of several different ways based on where you live. 

### Option 1 - Your bank is in the list of countries we can pay automatically
If your bank is in one of the countries on the Bill.com list of service areas (https://help.bill.com/direct/s/article/360007172671#countries-bank-branch-identifier-and-currency-supported) then we will process your information automatically. We will generate an invoice for you and you will receive an email from our accountant (Jitasa) or Bill.com to enter your banking information. Then you will be paid within 30 days. We strongly suggest you select electronic payment as the method as this is the fastest and most secure way for you to be paid.

### Option 2 - You live in a country we cannot automatically pay
If you live outside of the above list of countries, we will pay you via wire transfer via the banking details you provide us during enrollment. Please ensure that you provide an account that can receive international wire transfers in the amount that you can be paid. 

### Option 3 - You live in Iran
If you live in Iran, you can be paid, but we cannot send the money to you directly. Through our OFAC license here in the United States we are allowed to “facilitate payment” to you, but we cannot send money into Iran. This means you need to have a trusted friend/family member outside of Iran who can receive the money on your behalf. You MUST indicate in your banking details form that you require a PROXY. Fill out your banking details with the information of your PROXY.Please ensure that you provide a proxy bank account that can receive international wire transfers in the amount that you can be paid. 

## Paid by a Neuromatch partner (very few people):
You will have been notified if this applies to you.

If you are paid directly by a partner organization we have sent your name and contact information to that organization. You will be contacted directly by that organization to arrange your payment. If you are on this list, you will have been notified by email.
Timeline

## Timing
In most cases, we aim to complete all TA payments within 30 days of receiving your invoice for the course for which you are a TA. If you are an independent contractor not tied to a specific course, we will aim to complete payment within 30 days of receiving your invoice. Based on our experience, this 30-day goal is reasonable except in exceptional circumstances (like Iran, Bolivia, Senegal, Pakistan, and Nigeria), where sometimes sorting out the details takes a bit longer and/or banks put a hold on funds until they can cross reference our OFAC license or other legal documentation. 

## Questions
If you have read all the above steps and you still have questions, please email nma@neuromatch.io with the subject line “TA payment question” and we will get back to you as soon as we can. Thank you for being part of this! We can’t do this without you!
