# Expectations (7-9 hours per day, Monday-Friday)

The NMA courses are designed to be intensely interactive and engaging.  You should plan to have a lot of time to devote to the course on each weekday for the duration of the course.  Try not to schedule other major intellectual activities during the course to allow yourself time to rest and reflect on what you have been learning and to join NMA social activities.  This document outlines what your roles and responsibilities will be as someone taking the course.  


As a student, you will bring your own expertise into the course and this determines in part what you will learn. Students who have less experience with a given skill set, like coding or neuroscience, will find some parts of the course very challenging.  This is normal, and you should not feel too frustrated, especially after the first two days. Even if you cannot master the content, you will still learn a lot. Also, you can always go back and revisit the material again after the course is over, weeks, months or even years from now. The tutorials and videos will be available online for as long as you need them.  


As an NMA student you will be expected to:


-    Be present for every day of the Academy in your designated time slots (we will choose a time slot for you based on your indicated availability in the Round 2 application).  This consists of two parts:
     -    Attend the tutorial with your pod and TAs (approximately 5.5 hours with a 1 hour break in the middle)
     -    Attend the project time slot with members of the pod for 2-3 hours each day in addition to the tutorial session.
     - If you need to take a day or two off to do something else please discuss it with your TAs. 
-    Review materials for the course prior to the start of each day’s tutorial.  This could be a lecture for you to watch, or something to read. 
-    Actively work with other students in small groups to discuss lecture materials, tutorials, and to develop your group’s project
-    We will use the Discord.com platform to communicate with each other. This is a great way to expand your network of contacts and to meet other students.  [If you are located in a region where Discord is blocked, we have worked to implement regional alternatives].
-    Let the TA know if you need to miss classes due to illness/other unavoidable circumstances. 
-    Be respectful and understanding of cultural differences. Please review the code of conduct.
-    Complete 5 min daily reflection surveys to help you think about the course material and provide anonymous feedback on how your day went working within your pod.
-    Refresh your knowledge of or learn the prerequisite Python, math and (for comp neuro) neuroscience before the course. See the qualifications section below for more information.
-    Your group will be developing a project during the course. Spend some time in advance of day 1 to think about ideas for this project related to our provided datasets or think about a theory project that might be interesting, but remain open to the ideas of your group as well. You will make the most progress if you learn to collaborate well.
-    Pay your registration fee. Most students are able to get their registration fee paid for by their institution or employer, typically through a reimbursement program for additional training. If you don’t know how to approach this, we provide an instruction guide in our payment portal. Because payment is made through our payment portal, we cannot accept bank transfers directly from your institution. As always, the payment process in our portal will ensure that Neuromatch is affordable to you or your institution.

We encourage participation in professional development sessions as a means to develop a professional network in the discipline.  These will occur as optional sessions on the weekends during the academy. More details about this will be given subsequently.
You will also be offered the opportunity to participate in mentoring sessions with leaders in computational neuroscience and DL from around the world. We encourage you to make the best out of those unique opportunities!


Remember most importantly that this Academy is what you make it.  Our curriculum is designed to work best for active learning, so you should support your fellow students, ask questions of the TA, challenge the speakers at Q&A sessions, be an active participant in your group. Make new friends on Discord. You’ll also be able to build your network of contacts, with your TA, other students, and the instructional faculty and mentors for your group project or in other sessions. Create opportunities to engage, learn and build connections! Neuromatch Academy is an immersive, intense experience but we hope you will have a fantastic time!


## Qualifications for Computational Neuroscience Course
-   Minimum experience with Python, including relevant Python libraries (numpy, scipy and sklearn). We will reach out soon with NMA-made materials that provide an introduction to Python that you can go through on your own. We also include other resources to learn Python on our Prerequisites and Preparatory Materials page.
-   A minimum understanding of neuroscience. We are currently developing a series of introductory neuroscience videos and will reach out to you when those are available to help get you up to speed if this is new to you. 
-   Basic knowledge in linear algebra, probability, statistics, and calculus. We will have an optional 3 day pre-reqs refresher course on these topics on June 30th, July 1st, and July 2nd. All incoming CN students will have the option to participate in this refresher course.  You will receive a follow-up email after confirming your attendance with additional information, including the option to sign-up to join the refresher course.  Please consult our CN Prerequisites and Preparatory Materials page for more information and suggestions on how to prepare.

## Qualifications for Deep Learning Course
-   Minimum experience with Python, including relevant Python libraries (numpy, scipy and sklearn). We will reach out to some of you about Python resources based on the information you put in your application.
-   A minimum understanding of neuroscience. We will reach out to you with a series of videos to help get you up to speed if this is new to you. 
-   Basic knowledge in Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Calculus.
Please consult our DL Prerequisites and Preparatory Materials page for more information and suggestions on how to achieve those prerequisites if not yet present.


## Evaluations:

There will be a survey that we would like you to complete before and after the course in order to gauge learning outcomes. This is not a form of grading, or a test. We’d just like to know how much you have learned in the course. These surveys also help us demonstrate how NMA works to people or organizations that might donate money to Neuromatch to help pay for TAs, so we hope you will help us keep Neuromatch Academy accessible to everyone by filling them out honestly and completely! Thank you!
