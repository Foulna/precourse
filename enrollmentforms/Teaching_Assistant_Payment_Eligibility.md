# Hello! Thank you for applying as a teaching assistant!

## Teaching Assistant Eligibility

Our teaching assistants come from all of over the world and with many different backgrounds and unique situations. As a nonprofit organization in the United States, we can pay most people! But there are some circumstances that present challenges. 

Here is an easy flow chart to help understand most cases. 

This flowchart is intended to provide *general guidance* only and should not be taken as legal advice. Because the rules are different for every country, Neuromatch is **not** authorized to officially determine your eligibility to be employed as an independent contractor under the terms of your citizenship, residency, current location, and/or visa status. 

If you have questions about your specific home country and/or visa situation, or whether you are eligible to be paid as an independent contractor in the United States, you’ll need to ask one or more of the following resources:
- The international student/employee office at your home university or company
- Your personal tax consultant

Ask these people whether you are eligible to be paid as an “Independent Contractor” by a United States company according to your citizenship or visa status.
