Am I allowed to be paid as a teaching assistant?

We receive a lot of questions about how TAs are paid, and whether a particular person is allowed to be paid via the mechanisms we have available as a United States based nonprofit organization. Here is an easy flow chart to help you understand. 

This flowchart is intended to provide general guidance only and should not be taken as legal advice. Because the rules are different for every country, Neuromatch is not authorized to officially determine your eligibility to be employed as an independent contractor under the terms of your citizenship, residency, current location, and/or visa status. 

If you have questions about your specific home country and/or visa situation, or whether you are eligible to be paid as an independent contractor in the United States, you’ll need to ask one or more of the following resources:
- The international student/employee office at your home university or company
- Your personal tax consultant

Ask these people whether you are eligible to be paid as an “Independent Contractor” by a United States company according to your citizenship or visa status.
